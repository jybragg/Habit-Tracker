# Habit-Tracker

* This app lets users input the habits they'd like to accomplish.

* Whenever a user submits a habit, the app will display the habit on the left side of the page -- waiting to be accomplished.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Accomplished!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every habit in the MySQL database, whether accomplished or not.

## Technologies used:

MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, Bootstrap
